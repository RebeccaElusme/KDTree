# KDTree
I was given a set of 569 instances, each with information about a patientâ€™s cell, that is or is not cancerous. 
I was asked to design, implement, and train a machine learning model, and assess its quality in terms of (a) accuracy of diagnosis (of instances not used for training) and (b) computational efficiency and scalability of your solution. 
I was required to use a tree data structure that would optimize both accuracy and efficiency (with accuracy taking precedence).
